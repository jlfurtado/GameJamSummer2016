This respository contains files pertaining to a Game Jam someplace in the world.

## Cube V1.0

You are cube, the defender of the polyverse, tasked with defeating the dreaded Cone! This game features 4 main levels. Complete a color level and unlock another color level. Levels range from Blue, Green, Orange, and Red. A bonus level awaits once you've defeated the cone. 
Collect the Collectables, get the Collectable Multipliers, and go for a high score! Local leaderboards included.

This project was in development for over a decade in delta time. In human terms, that's three days. I think.

###Controls:
  * WASD to move and strafe.
  * Click and move mouse to look around.
  * Space to jump
  * Alt + F4 to exit the application.
  * Power button to shut down the computer.
  * Delete System32 to delete System32.

Of course, there's bugs. I wonder how they got in. I thought this game only comprised of only low poly models. Did they get in through the code?
